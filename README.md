# casino
A collection of python utility functions

Inspired by https://github.com/brentyi/fifteen.

This is a collection of functions I keep re-using across projects.

## Installation
If you do not plan to modify `casino` you can simply install it through
```[bash]
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com:SuperN1ck/casino.git
```
or an editable version
```[bash]
cd path/to/to/dest
git clone https://github.com/SuperN1ck/casino
cd casino
pip install -e .
```

## Contributing
All contributions are welcome. Code is formatted with `black` and default parameters.
